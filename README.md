# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
This process is accomplished through communication with the various members of the team and the client. Most notably, Daily Scrums are the best example of this. Relaying information to everyone on the team, problems found, etc. is a great way to make sure everybody is on the same page. User stories also make sure all requirments are met when implementing features into a program.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Deciding between Waterfall or Agile is a good place to start. When working with Agile, Scrum and Kanban are the most important to incorporate in my opinion. A team comprised of members who can communicate effectively and work together like a well oiled machine is what makes a solid backbone for an organization and is the key for successfully delievering a quality product to the client.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
There are a lot of traits that make somebody a good team member in software development, but I feel like having good communication skills and being adaptible in every possible situation are the most important. Communicating problems and being able to adjust accordingly are both the keys to success in this field.
